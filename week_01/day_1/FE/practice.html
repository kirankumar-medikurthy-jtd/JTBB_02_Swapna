	It is believed that Krishna enchants the world, but Radha enchants even him. Therefore,<br>
	she is the supreme goddess of all and together they are called as Radha-Krishna. In many Vaishnava sections,<br>
	 Radha Krishna are often identified as the avatars of Lakshmi Narayan.

	<h1>Important text</h1>
	<strong>
	Krishna refused to bear arms in the great war between the Kauravas (sons of Dhritarashtra, the descendant of Kuru)<br>
	 and the Pandavas (sons of Pandu), but he offered a choice of his personal attendance to one side and the loan<br> 
	 of his army to the other. The Pandavas chose the former, and Krishna thus served as charioteer for Arjuna, one of <br>
	 the Pandava brothers. On his return to Dvaraka, a brawl broke out one day among the Yadava chiefs in which Krishnaâ€™s<br>
	  brother and son were slain. As the god sat in the forest lamenting, a huntsman, mistaking him for a deer, <br>
	  shot him in his one vulnerable spot, the heel, killing him.

	The love of Radha and Krishna is immortal, it has no beginning and end. It is beyond the physical <br>
	world and is spiritual in nature. It was the pure bond and love that kept both united, not marriage.<br>
	 Because every love story doesn't end in marriage.

	From mythological to this technological era, Radha Krishna has always been symbolised as a benchmark of love.<br>
	These two words in our Indian history are never been taken separately. Whenever we talk about Radha, it is impossible <br>
	for any human being to not to think about Lord Krishna. It definitely strikes our head and compels us to think at least<br>
	 once about the everlasting tale of love.
